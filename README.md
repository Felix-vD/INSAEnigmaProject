Clone the repository and make sure to install the necessary dependencies, they include:

!pip install notebook
!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib 

I think thats all
The code for the Turing Bombe is in the enigma-breaking notebook
The code for the Modern approach and just some testing and playing around with the python library is in the EnigmaTooEasy notebook.

Have Fun! :-)
